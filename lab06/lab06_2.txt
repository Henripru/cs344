Exercise 6.2

Henri Prudhomme

ML problem - model to identify whether an email in Gmail is “important.”

1. We want the machine learned model to:
identify whether an email in Gmail is “important.”

2. Our ideal outcome is:
Can successfully identify whether an email in Gmail is “important.”

3a. Our sucess metrics are:
That important emails are the emails that are actually determined to be important

3b. Our key results (KR) for the success metrics are:
That the email will be determined to be "important" or "unimportant"

3c. Our ML model is deemed a failure if:
It cannot consitently identify important emails

4a. The output from our ML model will be:
a boolean

4b. The output is defined as:
a classification problem where there is a discrete boolean value to tell whether the email is important or not

5a. The output from the ML model will be made:
available to an algorithm which shows the user important emails

5b. The outcome will be used for:
email applications

6. If we didn't use ML, we would:
use a bayesain approach

7a. Our problem is best framed as:
a binary classification

8. 
rows consist of a email. output is a boolean value whether important or not

9. 
inputs are sender, subject, and body of email

10. 
'henripru@gmail.com', 'Calvin Cs344 Help', 'hello professor, i need some help' -> important
'junk@asdf.qwasdfoas', 'Check this CRAZY Thing!!!', 'You havent seen anything like this before!!!!!' -> nonimportant
