    "all except min_conflicts were able to consistently solve the easier puzzles. The dfs couldnt solve the harder puzzles in a timely manner because the tree that it has to search is enormous and takes to long to traverse. the ac3 coudlnt solve the puzzles in a timely manner because there are too many arc consistencies to manage. backtracking deosnt solve the problem in a timely manner either because there is still so many possible combinations on the way to a solution that it can get pretty deep into a search, but then have to back out because it finds some conflict. min_conflicts is a local search, so it can get hung on a local but not global maximum.\n",
