a. What does the confusion matrix show for this example?
The confusion matrix shows which classes were misclassified as other classes.
In this example, it shows  7 and 9 can get confused for one another

b. How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.
In tensorflow we had to more precisely define the parameters for the model. With Keras we could just add layers which was much easier.

My best accuracy was 0.94

c. What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?
The image gets clearer as I increase the number of steps.
