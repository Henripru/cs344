Exercise 1:
Whatâ€™s the size/shape of the cats/dogs datasets?
total training cat images: 1000
total training dog images: 1000
total validation cat images: 500
total validation dog images: 500

How does the first CNN compare with the one we did in class.
3 convolutional layers using relu.
they use 16, 32, 64 for the layers.
both flatten the image.

Can you see any interesting patterns in the intermediate representations?
Yes. The major shapes in the pictures are maintained even as the resolution decreases.
