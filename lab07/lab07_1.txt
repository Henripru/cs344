Excercise 7.1 

a. 
Ex1. cities['Large and Saintly'] = (cities['City name'].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San'))) & ( cities['City name'] > 50)
Ex2. cities.reindex(np.random.permutation([1, 2, 3, 4])

b. One would want to use pandas because it organizes its data into Dataframes and Series. While numpy only uses simple arrays. Data manipulation is far easier.

c. It is useful to reorder/shuffle a Pandas DataFrame because it easy to quickly create new training data without having to go and manually look up or create it by hand.
