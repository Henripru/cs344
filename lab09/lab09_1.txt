Excersise 9,1

A. The linear regression approach is terrible. The RMSE is 0.44 in a range of [0, 1].

Task 1: L2 Loss doesnt penalise bad answers very badly. In contrast, LogLoss penalises missing very strongly.

Task 2: Logistic regression is even worse than linear regression as the logistic regressino RMSE is 0.53. Even after adjusting values, I couldn't get the RMSE lower.

Task 3: 
linear_classifier = train_linear_classifier_model(
    learning_rate=0.00005,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=1000,
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

AUC on the validation set: 0.73
Accuracy on the validation set: 0.75
