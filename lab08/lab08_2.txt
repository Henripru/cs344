a. The pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables. It has a value between +1 and -1. Latitude and longitude have a -.9 relationship. this is because they are axes and have no relation at all. They are input parameters and couldnt even have a relation.

b. 

Task 1:

I could not manipulate the learning rates or batch size to improve the model from what the google rmse was on this one.

Task 2:

minimal_features = [
  "total_bedrooms",
  "total_rooms",
]

minimal_training_examples = training_examples[minimal_features]
minimal_validation_examples = validation_examples[minimal_features]

_ = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=500,
    training_examples=minimal_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=minimal_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

Final RMSE 166.67
