Task 1: What are the biases present in the given dataset?
There is a data skew in gender as we would expect it to be 50/50 but instead there are more men than women
Task 2: Assess the potential bias in some other feature besides education level.
There is a bias in marital_status. I would expect to see 50/50 representation for each category, but there are always more men, divorced, married-spouse-absent, never-married, separated, and widowed
Task 3: Do as written.

Task 4: Do you find disparities when you look at race rather than gender? If so, which way to they skew?
In looking at race, the model has more false positives when evaluating blacks tahn whites.
